HackMIT submission 2022

GardenShare is a free online marketplace facilitating sharing garden/backyard space for growing fresh and sustainable fruits and vegetables and making community connections. Users can search for local garden spaces and determine what works best for them, then apply to be able to use that space.

We hope to help underserved families gain access to fresh and healthy food, promote composting, preserve green spaces in cities, increase biodiversity, improve soil conditions, dramatically decrease participantsâ€™ food-caused carbon footprint to almost nothing, connect people with the earth, and strengthen community bonds.
To pay for the gardens needs, we implemented a system where companies can choose specific neighborhoods to donate to. We are looking into getting data to see what communities can best be served. This will promote decreasing CO2 emissions, while generously giving back to their local community or a community experiencing food insecurity.

For further work on this app, we plan to implement a forum system to further connect the community and encourage questions such as 'How do I save water usage in my yard?' 'How do I upcycle old materials into planters?', discuss composting, or give away extra produce to combat food waste.
